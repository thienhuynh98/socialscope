Little guy isn\u2019t even a year old yet, but this has been something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot. Stresses me out thinking how to navigate conversations with schools, peers, and family.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago, I didn\u2019t think twice about being a member at the San Diego Zoo, visiting the wild animal park, or Seaworld. Then I saw Blackfish and it opened my eyes. I started casually researching the consciousness of animals. It wasn\u2019t until touring an animal research facility conducting medical device testing on dogs that I realized I want to be deliberately mindful of what is necessary and unnecessary when it comes to our interactions with animals.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of the AZA before the responses here. I spent a good chunk of time reading through their accreditation standards and recommendations and it doesn\u2019t change how I feel in the slightest. In fact, reading their care manual for gorillas reinforced my beliefs. Let\u2019s face it - gorillas, elephants, big cats, penguins, etc. just don\u2019t fuckin belong in a zoo in Detroit, Michigan. Hence why they gave away their elephants on ethical grounds (only once they were aging and arthritic).\n\nPersonally, I like the ideas of natural history museums, nature centers, and national parks best. Requiring more research - sanctuaries, refuges, etc. Farms are a topic of discussion for another day, I suppose, given that so many are horrible to their animals/product. And yes, as my son gets older, documentaries will become important.","poster_id":"t2_fgyhxphu","lang":""},{"comment_count":646,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":false,"created_at":1636865616,"title":"Three snow leopards die of COVID-19 at Nebraska zoo","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qtidpb","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":7200,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_afk4t","lang":""},{"comment_count":303,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":false,"created_at":1636300587,"title":"TIL that many birds do not breed very well in small flocks and that Zoos use mirrors to help increase reproduction.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qorbr0","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":25822,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_foii5v13","lang":""},{"comment_count":256,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637330896,"title":"this zoo has an area where you can play tug of war with a lion","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qxgyky","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":7360,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_dv6prqcb","lang":""},{"comment_count":112,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637632742,"title":"Aardwolf in the Cincinnati zoo, it's the world's smallest Hyena and feeds exclusively on insects, and actively detests meat unless softened or well cooked.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_r02119","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":13414,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_8giy73r2","lang":""},{"comment_count":150,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637328331,"title":"Roland, a 4,000 pound Elephant Seal interacting with his keeper at the Berlin Zoo, circa 1930\u2019s","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qxg5oj","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":12488,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_twguw5m","lang":""},{"comment_count":323,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637302718,"title":"Let's Build Zoo sold 99% of copies on Steam, only 1% in EGS, according to the dev.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qx9zjx","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":1888,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_h1i22","lang":""}]}
